# What is EN 10269:2013 and why is it important for fasteners?
 
EN 10269:2013 is a European standard that specifies the requirements for semi-finished products, bars and rods for fasteners with properties specified at elevated and/or low temperatures. It covers non-alloy and alloy (including stainless) steels and nickel alloys as given in table 1 of the standard[^1^].

Fasteners are components that are used to join or secure two or more parts together, such as bolts, nuts, screws, studs, washers, etc. Fasteners are often exposed to harsh environments, such as high or low temperatures, corrosive media, high pressure, etc. Therefore, they need to have adequate mechanical properties and resistance to degradation at the specified service conditions.
 
EN 10269:2013 provides a list of steels and nickel alloys that have been tested and proven to have suitable properties for fasteners at elevated and/or low temperatures. The standard also specifies the chemical composition, mechanical properties, heat treatment and testing methods for these materials. The standard may be applied to the finished fasteners as well as to the semi-finished products, bars and rods.
 
EN 10269:2013 is important for fasteners because it ensures that they have a consistent quality and performance across different manufacturers and suppliers. It also facilitates the harmonization of the laws of the European Union member states relating to the making available on the market of pressure equipment[^1^]. Pressure equipment is any equipment that contains fluids under pressure, such as boilers, pressure vessels, piping, valves, etc. Fasteners are essential components of pressure equipment and need to comply with the relevant directives and standards.
 
EN 10269:2013 is a revision of EN 10269:1999, which incorporated corrigenda nos. 1, 2 and 3 and amendment no. 1[^2^]. The main changes in EN 10269:2013 are:
 
- The addition of new steel grades (e.g. X8CrNiMoVNb16-13) and nickel alloys (e.g. NiCr19NbMo) to table 1;
- The modification of some chemical composition limits and mechanical property values for some existing grades;
- The introduction of a new heat treatment condition (solution annealed and precipitation hardened) for some nickel alloys;
- The clarification of some testing methods and requirements.

EN 10269:2013 is available in English, German and French languages. It can be purchased online from various sources, such as CEN (European Committee for Standardization), BSI (British Standards Institution), DIN (German Institute for Standardization), etc. Alternatively, it can be accessed online from some e-libraries or document sharing platforms[^2^] [^3^].
  
Some examples of applications where fasteners made of steels and nickel alloys according to EN 10269:2013 are used are:

- Power generation plants, such as nuclear, fossil-fuel, geothermal, etc.;
- Petrochemical and chemical plants, such as refineries, gas processing, fertilizer production, etc.;
- Offshore and marine structures, such as oil and gas platforms, pipelines, ships, etc.;
- Cryogenic equipment, such as liquefied natural gas (LNG) storage tanks, transport vessels, etc.;
- Aerospace and defense equipment, such as jet engines, rockets, missiles, etc.

In these applications, fasteners are subjected to various combinations of high or low temperatures, high pressure, corrosive media, fatigue loading, etc. Therefore, they need to have adequate strength, toughness, ductility, corrosion resistance and durability at the specified service conditions. EN 10269:2013 provides a reliable and comprehensive source of information for selecting the appropriate materials for fasteners for these applications.
